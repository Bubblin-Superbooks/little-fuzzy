He reached out to the screen panel and began punching a combination. A spectacled young man appeared and greeted him</p><p>deferentially.</p><p>"Good morning, Mr. Wilkins," he replied. "A couple of homicides at the head of this morning's docket--Holloway and Kellogg, both from Beta Fifteen. What is known about them?"</p><p>The young man began to laugh.

Mr. O'Brien has entered nolle prosequi on both of them, so the whole thing can be disregarded."</p></div> </div>
