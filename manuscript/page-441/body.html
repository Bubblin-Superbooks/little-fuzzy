We just want your opinion in general terms, now."</p><p>"Well, the sapient mind can generalize. To the nonsapient animal, every experience is either totally novel or identical with some remembered experience. A rabbit will flee from one dog because to the rabbit mind it is identical with another dog that has chased it. A bird will be attracted to an apple, and each apple will be a unique red thing to peck at. The sapient being will say, 'These red objects are apples; as a class, they are edible and flavorsome.' He sets up a class under the general label of apples. This, in turn, leads to the formation of abstract ideas--redness, flavor, et cetera--conceived of apart from any specific physical object, and to the ordering of abstractions--'fruit' as distinguished from apples, 'food' as distinguished from fruit."</p></div> </div>
