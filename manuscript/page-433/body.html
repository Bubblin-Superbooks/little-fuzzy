Their names are Complex, Syndrome, Id and Superego."</p><p>"Your Fuzzies, Lieutenant?"</p><p>"Well, I took care of them and worked with them; Juan Jimenez and some Company hunters caught them over on Beta Continent. They were kept at a farm center about five hundred miles north of here, which had been vacated for the purpose. I spent all my time with them, and Dr. Mallin was with them most of the time. Then, on Monday night, Mr. Coombes came and got them."</p><p>"Mr. Coombes, did you say?" Gus Brannhard asked.</p><p>"Mr. Leslie Coombes, the Company attorney. He said they were needed in Mallorysport. It wasn't till the next day that I found out what they were needed for. They'd been turned loose in front of that Fuzzy hunt, in the hope that they would be killed."</p></div> </div>
