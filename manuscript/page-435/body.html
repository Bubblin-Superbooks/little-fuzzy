"We can hear the testimony of the people who worked with them there at any time. Now, I want to hear from Dr. Ernst Mallin."</p><p>Coombes was on his feet again. "Your Honors, before any further testimony is heard, I would like to confer with my client privately."</p><p>"I fail to see any reason why we should interrupt proceedings for that purpose, Mr. Coombes. You can confer as much as you wish with your client after this session, and I can assure you that you will be called upon to do nothing on his behalf until then." He gave a light tap with his gavel and then said: "Dr. Ernst Mallin will please take the stand."</p></div> </div>
