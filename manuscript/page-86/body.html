That's all the name I know for them."</p><p>A couple of Fuzzies came over and looked up at Lieutenant Lunt; one of them said, "Yeek?"</p><p>"They want to know what you are, so that makes it mutual."</p><p>Lunt hesitated for a moment, then took off his belt and holster and hung it on one of the pegs inside the door, putting his beret over it. Khadra followed his example promptly. That meant that they considered themselves temporarily off duty and would accept a drink if one were offered. A Fuzzy was pulling at Ahmed Khadra's trouser leg and asking to be noticed, and Mamma Fuzzy was holding Baby up to show to Lunt. Khadra, rather hesitantly, picked up the Fuzzy who was trying to attract his attention.</p></div> </div>
